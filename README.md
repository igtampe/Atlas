# The UMS Wiki (Atlas)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49919240/163685504-8afe786e-e4af-46a8-be56-46ccc207413b.png)


Atlas is a small quick Wiki software, and this implementation uses it for the UMS Wiki. It re-uses a lot of stuff from Neco and Clothespin (packages which would later be called ChopoAuth, ChopoImageHandling, and the allpowerful ChopoSessionManager which are now available on [Igtampe Commons](https://www.github.com/igtampe/igtampecommons))

## Markup
It doesn't use any normal markup language, instead using a basic markdown-esque custom language. It includes utilties for:

- ```=Sections and ==subsections``` (Up to 6)
- ```*Italic text*```, ```**Bold Text**```, ```__Underlined Text__``` (and combinations)
- ```[Links | https://www.google.com]```, ```[Links to other articles | Article] or [Article]```
- ```[IMG| Images | With Alt Text | https://www.imagehost.com/image.png]```(with optional floating position as | LEFT, TOP, or RIGHT)
- ```
    - Lists 
        - With subitems
- ```
    # Numbered Lists
        # With subitems
- ```

====And So on
=====And So Forth
I am the text from ""and so forth"". **This text should be bold**, *This text should be italicized* ***This text should be both bold and italicized***, and __***This text should be italicized, bold, and underlined***__. [This Text | Text] should link to a wiki page called ""Text"". [This Text | https://www.google.com] should link to google.
